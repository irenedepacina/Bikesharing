# Overview of this Analysis 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The decision on whether or not to create a bike sharing business in Dos Moines, Iowa based on the success and data in New York City. Several visualizations were created to construct a final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results 
The following visualizations were used in my Tableau Story. Included are a description of the results of each visualization.
1. ![](https://github.com/irenedepacina/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout%20Time%20for%20Users.png)
- The length of time the bikes are checked out for all riders. Based on the results, as the day goes by, users tend to check in after an extended period of time. We see an incline until hour 5. Afterwards, we start to see a decline.
2. ![](https://github.com/irenedepacina/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout%20Time%20by%20Gender.png)
- The length of time the bikes are checked out for all genders. Similar to the visualization above, as the day goes by, users tend to check in after an extended period of time. We see an incline up until hour 5, after that point we begin to see a decline.
3. ![](https://github.com/irenedepacina/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20Per%20Hour.png)
- The number of trips taken by the hour for each day of the week for all riders. Based on the results, we can see that the peak hours are 7am and 5-7pm on weekdays, and 10am to 6pm on Saturdays. 
4. ![](https://github.com/irenedepacina/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)
- The number of trips taken by the hour for each day of the week for all riders. Based on the results, majority of the bikers in the bike sharing program are male. 
5. ![](https://github.com/irenedepacina/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Users%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender. Based on the results, majority of the bikers in the bike sharing program are subscribers.
6. ![](https://github.com/irenedepacina/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/August%20Peak%20Hours.png)
- The August Peak hours. Based on the visualization, the hours the generate most riders are 5pm followed by 6pm and 7am.
7. ![](https://github.com/irenedepacina/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top%20Starting%20Locations.png)
- The top starting points in New York City. The top locations are in Soho, an area that is drawns in a lot of students and tourists. 

## Summary 

Based on the results, convincing a group of investors to start in Dos Moines, Iowa based on the success in New York City is difficult. New York City sees thousands of tourists in a given year in addition to their permanent residents. It is difficult to conclude that Dos Moines will see the same results as New York given the difference in population and tourist attractions. However, if a bike sharing program were to exist in Dos Moines, we can expect that the peak hours are 7am and 5pm. This is valid assumption because it is a timeframe when people are commuting to and from work. Biking is a great alternative for commuters. In addition, we can assume that most of the riders will be male and subscribers based on the New York City results. Lastly, we can see a rise in the number of rides in August since there are students on break from school, tourists, and nice weather.

Two additional visualizations that can be performed with the given dataset:
1. The avaverage distance traveled for all riders for each week of the day.
2. The average distance traveled for each type of user for each week of the day.
