# Overview of this Analysis 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The decision on whether or not to create a bike sharing business in Dos Moines, Iowa based on the success and data in New York City. Several visualizations were created to construct a final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

- The length of time the bikes are checked out for all genders. Similar to the visualization above, as the day goes by, users tend to check after an extended period of time. We see an incline until hour 5 when we start to see an decline.
3. ![](https://github.com/irenedepacina/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20Per%20Hour.png)

## Summary 

Based on the results, convincing a group of investors to start in Dos Moines, Iowa based on the success in New York City is difficult. New York City sees thousands of tourists in a given year in addition to their permanent residents. However, if a bike sharing program were to exist in Dos Moines, we can expect that the peak hours are 7am and 5pm. This is valid assumption because it is a time when people are commuting to and from work. This is a great alternative for commuters. In addition, we can assume that most of the riders will be male and subscribers based on the New York City results. Lastly, we can see the number of rides increase in August since there are students on break from school, tourists, and nice weather.

Two additional visualizations that can be performed with the given dataset:
1. The avaverage distance traveled for all riders for each week of the day.
2. The average distance traveled for each type of user for each week of the day.
